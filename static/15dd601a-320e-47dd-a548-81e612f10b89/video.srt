00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,880
I used to say I was too tired for every night, but what I was really tired of was the pressure

2
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,520
that I had to be instantly turned on and the fear that I wouldn't be. I was tired of beating

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:16,320
myself up in my head for not being into it. I was tired of feeling guilty if I didn't

4
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:22,080
and then faking it to get it over with. I was tired of the loop of putting on a show for my

5
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:26,880
partner and pretending to like things that I didn't to protect his feelings and not ruin the mood.

6
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,680
All of that is exhausting, but when I broke out of that cycle and finally learned what my body

7
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:35,600
needed to turn on, what I liked in the bedroom and how to communicate that with my partner,

8
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:39,760
this feels like something that actually energizes me instead of drains me.
